    "# Introduction to Application Programing Interface (API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Programing Interfaces, or API's, are interfaces or communication protocols between different parts of a computer program intded to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. In other words, APIs act as an intermediary service between website data and your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "API's are useful for gathering specific data from a website that has lots of large data sets, or for routing data directly into an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are example of API's?\n",
    "    - US Census API - https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html\n",
    "    - NOAA API - https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2\n",
    "    - GoogleMaps API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation\n",
    "    \n",
    "Requesting data from a website over and over again can be expensive for the website managing the data. Many API's have limits to the number of calls you can do with your API key, either on a per day basis or overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Start Using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "To use some APIs, one must first procure an API key. An API key is a unique identifier that personally associates you with data requests. API keys are free to procure, however, services that are called upon by your API key may cost money, depending on the site and service (i.e., Geocoding in Google Maps)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other API's are websites that present information in JSON format that can be imported directly into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "API's aren't exclusive to Python and are seen in a myriad of different software, such as R."
